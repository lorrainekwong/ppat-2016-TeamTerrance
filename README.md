# ppat-2016-TeamTerrance

Final team project construction for PPAT (Principles & Practices of Assistive Technology) class in fall 2016.  
Team: Berenice, Devin, Marian, Lorraine  
Project: Research, test, and create a solution for Terrance to play bingo.   
Solution: We designed & 3D printed a case that fits the specific bingo cards Terrance uses (see .dxf files). Each bingo slot includes an LED to replace physical chips, all wired to an Arduino (see .ino file). We then wrote a program, designed to be used by Terrance interacting with his computer using Dragon Naturally Speaking, in which he could click on a virtual UI that then marks his physical bingo board by turning on the LEDs (see .py file), building a bridge between the physical bingo game and his comfort with digital interfaces.
