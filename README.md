# ppat-2016-TeamTerrance

Final team project construction for PPAT (Principles & Practices of Assistive Technology) class in fall 2016. 
Team: Berenice, Devin, Marian, Lorraine
Project: Research, test, and create a solution for Terrance to play bingo. 
We designed & 3D printed a case that fits the specific bingo cards Terrance uses. Each bingo slot includes an LED to replace physical chips. The Arduino & code uploaded here allows Terrance to use a program that we designed for his computer to click on a virtual UI that then marks his physical bingo board.
